## How to Add Achievements for Cracked Games

If your cracked game does not show achievements, follow these steps:

1. **Use SteamAutoCracker**

   - Run SteamAutoCracker and select the ALI crack option for your game.

2. **Copy `valve.ini`**

   - After setup, locate the `valve.ini` file generated by SteamAutoCracker if not copy the one from the repo and change AppId to your game id.
   - Copy `valve.ini` to your game folder.

3. **Folder Structure**

   - Make sure `valve.ini` is placed next to a directory called `Profile`.
   - Example structure (see Lies of P example in the screenshot):
     ```
     /YourGameFolder/
       valve.ini
       Profile/
       game.exe
       ...
     ```

   4. **Reference Screenshot Example**

      - For a visual guide, see the `setupLiesOfP.png` image in the `screenshots` folder. This shows the correct folder structure and placement of `valve.ini` and `Profile` for Lies of P.

4. **Add Game to Playnite**

   - When adding your game to Playnite, select the executable (`.exe`) that is next to `valve.ini` and the `Profile` folder.

5. **Refresh SuccessStory**
   - Open Playnite, go to the SuccessStory plugin, and hit refresh.
   - Achievements should now appear and work correctly.

**Tip:**  
If you still donâ€™t see achievements, double-check that your `valve.ini` and `Profile` folder are in the correct location, and that you are using the right executable.
